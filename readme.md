# NOSH ChartingSystem Lite

## Overview:
NOSH ChartingSystem Lite is a read-only, minimally featured version of [NOSH ChartingSystem](https://github.com/shihjay2/nosh2).  It is best installed as a Dockerized container.  Pre-built images are on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/shihjay2/nosh-lite).  Running a Docker Compose script that incorporates a MariaDB and NGINX container along with NOSH ChartingSystem Lite is the preferred method of deploying this.  An example docker-compose.yml file is included in this repository.  By default, there is no installed database upon initialization of the container.  If running this via Docker Compose, you should store the back up ZIP file in the root directory of where the docker-compose.yml file is located.  and when entering the root home page, you will automatically be directed to a file upload page.  The upload must be a ZIP file that is generated by NOSH ChartingSystem (via the /patient_data_export function) which contains a .sql backup file plus all the associated document files for the records backup.
